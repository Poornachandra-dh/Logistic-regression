# Logistic-regression
🔍 Simple Logistic Regression Classifier A beginner-friendly implementation of Logistic Regression using Python and scikit-learn. This project demonstrates how to use logistic regression for binary classification tasks, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
Here's a concise and clear **GitHub project description** for a **Simple Logistic Regression** project:

### 📌 Features

* Clean implementation using `scikit-learn`
* Works on a binary classification dataset (e.g., Titanic, Breast Cancer, or custom)
* Includes:

  * Data loading & preprocessing
  * Feature scaling
  * Train-test split
  * Model training & prediction
  * Accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC evaluation
  * Visualization of decision boundary (for 2D data)

### 🛠 Tech Stack

* Python
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* matplotlib / seaborn (for plots)

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook or script:
   `python logistic_regression.py` or open `logistic_regression.ipynb`

### 📁 Use Case Example

Predict whether a person has a disease (1) or not (0) based on input features like age, blood pressure, etc.
